Just like Bamboo, well bring up Crucible with the following command

`docker-compose up -d crucible`{{execute}}

> Note: You need to specify *Crucible instance directory* by setting the environment variable `FISHEYE_INST` to a path outside the installation directory.For example `FISHEYE_INST=/cruciblehome`.

Once Crucible is all set up, you can acces it from the link  https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8060-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com or click on the **Crucible** tab on the terminal window to proceed with configurations.
