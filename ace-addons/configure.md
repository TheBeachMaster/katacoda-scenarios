Now let's start our app. 

`npm run dev`{{execute}} 

Now your app is running on 

https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com 

Now add this URL inside your `config.json` *development* section by replacing the `https://ngrok-url` URL given as : 
```json
 "localBaseUrl": "https://ngrok-url"
```  
with your URL.
